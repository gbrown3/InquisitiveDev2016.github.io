  <p class="about"> Ali Haider </p>
  <p class="about2"> Portrait Photographer </p>
  <p class="description"> I was born in the US, but was raised for most of my life in <br>
    Canada. Initially, I used to have very little interest in visual arts and <br>
    thought that being good at it was something that you were born with. <br>
    However, photography has allowed me to better appreciate the work <br> that  goes
 into creating great art, and has given me an outlet to <br> show other people's personalities
to the best of my abilities. </p>
