# Photography Portfolio Website

 https://inquisitivedev2016.github.io/Photo%20Website/AboutMe

In order to learn more about Web Development and to have a professional portfolio for photography, I have decided to hand code my own portfolio website.

Technologies Used:
- <strong>HTML</strong> 
- <strong>CSS</strong>
- <strong> Javascript/ JQuery</strong>
- <strong>Php - for email contact forms and a function that validates email injection attempts</strong>

Things I will implement in the future/ need improving:

- Better code structure, making sure it's organized and well formatted
- Creating a database with SQL
- Creating some animations using AngularJS
- Enabling fullscreen mode when clicking on the pictures
- Creating an interface where I can add/remove pictures instead of manually coding it in.
- Learning more about web/ ux design
- Learning more about web security
